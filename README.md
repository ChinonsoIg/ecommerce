This app is built with React.
The styling is done with Bootstrap CDN.

The app utilises a mock data from Mockaroo.
By default, it displays all the profiles, in pages. Only twenty(20) profiles are displayed per page. You can click on the page numbers at the bottom to navigate other pages.

The user can search for a specific user by checking the criteria on the checkbox, and then typing the relevant characters in the search bar.
