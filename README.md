This app is built with React.
The styling is done with Bootstrap CDN.

The app fetches data from https://api.enye.tech/v1/challenge/records.
By default, it fetches all the profiles and displays it.  The user can search for a specific user by checking the checkbox, and then typing the name in the search bar.

The app is also paginated. You can click on the pages to get the rest of the fetched data, as only twenty(20) profiles are displayed per page.
